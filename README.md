# DE-Mon - Ekos Monitoring Tool for Astrophotography
DE-Mon is a simple service that can run on any machine using the [Astroberry](https://www.astroberry.io/) linux distribution that enables the user to remotely monitor via browser the session progress during the night.

You need to have a secure token that can be requested contacting me at [this email address](mailto:astropills.it@gmail.com).

I will create a new token for you that will allow you to have access to a simple dashboard hosted on my server, as soon as I have a better implementation of the server side it will be added to this repository so you can host it yourself elsewhere. :)

If you just want an executable to run on your Astroberry distribution get the compiled package from [here](https://github.com/aktasway-it/DE-Mon/releases)

If you instead want to run it as a Python application, just clone the repository wherever you like, open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you cloned the project and then run the command:

`pip install pyside6`

Once installed the dependency you don't need to run this command ever again, obviously. :)

To launch the application either double click **demon** or from the terminal run:

`./demon`

It's still a very early version, so bugs might be behind the corner, be aware!

Clear skies!
